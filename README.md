# AIRL-Insect-Walking

This project implements Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in MuJoCo-based continuous control environments. The framework supports both imitation learning and standard reinforcement learning pipelines. It is designed for investigating locomotion strategies, including future applications to a custom stick insect simulation model.


## Overview

- **Algorithms**: 
  - [x] AIRL (Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning)
  - [x] SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)

- **Simulation Environment**: [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/)

  - Hopper-v4: `logs/Hopper-v4/airl/20250313-1539`
- **Verified Environments for SAC**:
  - Ant-v4: `logs/Ant-v4/sac/20250314-1353` and `logs/Ant-v4/sac/20250314-1354`
  - Hopper-v4: `logs/Hopper-v4/sac/20250314-1353`
- **In Progress**:
  - Custom stick insect locomotion model (currently under development and debugging)
